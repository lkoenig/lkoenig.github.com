	Abstract = {The automatized beat detection and localization have been the subject of multiple research in the field of music infor- mation retrieval. Most of the methods are based on onset detection. We propose an alternative approach: Our method is based on the “Forward-Backward seg- mentation”: the segments may be interpreted as attacks, decays, sustains and releases of notes. We process the seg- ment boundaries as a weighted Dirac signal. Three meth- ods devived from its spectral analysis are proposed to find a periodicity which corresponds to the tempo.
  The experiments are carried out on a corpus of 100 songs of the RWC database. The performances of our system on this base demonstrate a potential in the use of a “ Forward- Backward Segmentation” for temporal information retrieval in musical signals.},

  Abstract = {The IRIM group is a consortium of French teams working on Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval. This paper describes our participation to the TRECVID 2010 semantic indexing and instance search tasks. For the semantic indexing task, we evaluated a number of different descriptors and tried different fusion strategies, in particular hierarchical fusion. The best IRIM run has a Mean Inferred Average Precision of 0.0442, which is above the task median performance. We found that fusion of the classification scores from different classifier types improves the performance and that even with a quite low individual performance, audio descriptors can help. For the instance search task, we used only one of the example images in our queries. The rank is nearly in the middle of the list of participants. The experiment showed that HSV features outperform the concatenation of HSV and Edge histograms or the Wavelet features.},

	Abstract = {In automatic speech analysis, voicing articulatory is often defined as a binary decision: voiced or unvoiced. Linguists agree that this articulatory should be continuous. In this paper, we present a new approach to compute a continuous voicing indicator of a speech frame. This voicing percentage is then evaluated in both a segmentation process and a speech recognition task. Promising results show that this continuous voicing percentage may be used as a reliable voicing indicator.},

This paper presents a new packet loss concealment algorithm which relies on one hidden Markov model. For this purpose, we introduce a continuous observation vector well-suited for silence, voiced and unvoiced sounds. We show that having a global HMM is relevant for this application. The proposed system is evaluated using standard PESQ score in a real-world application.},

	Abstract = {Packet loss due to misrouted or delayed packets in voice over IP leads to huge voice quality degradation. This paper presents a packet loss concealement algorithm which is independant from the vocoder. This method relies on hidden Markov model (HMM). A new voicing parameter is introduced to get over voiced/unvoiced sound separation and use a unique HMM. Since best parameter for prediction are not necessarily the best ones for synthesis, we introduce two separate vectors: the first one dedicated to the analysis of the signal and the second one featured for the synthesis of missing part. Performances of the proposed system are evaluated on parts of well-known speech corpora, leading to promising results.},

  abstract = {Packet loss due to misrouted or delayed packets in voice over IP leads to huge voice quality degradation. Packet loss concealment algorithms try to enhance the perceptive quality of the speech. The huge variety of vocoders leads us to propose a generic framework working directly on the speech signal available after decoding. The proposed system relies on one single "hidden Markov model" to model time evolution of acoustic features. An original indicator of continuous voicing is added to conventional parameters  (Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients) in order to handle voiced/unvoiced sound. 
Finding the best path with missing observations leads to one major contribution: a modified version of the Viterbi algorithm tailored for estimating missing observations. All contributions are assessed using both perceptual criteria and objective metrics.},
