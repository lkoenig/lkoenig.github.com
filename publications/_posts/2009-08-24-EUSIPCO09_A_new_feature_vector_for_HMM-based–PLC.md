Packet loss due to misrouted or delayed packets in voice over IP
 leads to huge voice quality degradation. Packet loss concealment
 algorithms try to enhance the quality of the speech. This paper
 presents a new packet loss concealment algorithm which relies on one
 hidden Markov model. For this purpose, we introduce a continuous
 observation vector well-suited for silence, voiced and unvoiced
 sounds. We show that having a global HMM is relevant for this
 application. The proposed system is evaluated using standard PESQ
 score in a real-world application.
