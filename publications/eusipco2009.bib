	Abstract = {Packet loss due to misrouted or delayed packets in voice over IP leads to huge voice quality degradation. Packet loss concealment algorithms try to enhance the quality of the speech. This paper presents a new packet loss concealment algorithm which relies on one hidden Markov model. For this purpose, we introduce a continuous observation vector well-suited for silence, voiced and unvoiced sounds. We show that having a global HMM is relevant for this application. The proposed system is evaluated using standard PESQ score in a real-world application.},
