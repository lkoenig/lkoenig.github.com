    <p>Research and development of a real time and interactive synthesizer of
    meteorological sounds: <a href="http://www.audiogaming.net/audioweather">AudioWeather</a>.
    Based on state of art approach, I developed and improved procedural audio

    <h4>Packet loss concealment on voice over IP</h4>
    <p class="abstract">
      Packet loss due to misrouted
    or delayed packets in voice over IP leads to huge voice quality
    degradation. Packet loss concealment algorithms try to enhance the
    perceptive quality of the speech. The huge variety of vocoders leads
    us to propose a generic framework working directly on the speech
    signal available after decoding. The proposed system relies on one
    single "hidden Markov model" to model time evolution of acoustic
    features. An original indicator of continuous voicing is added to
    conventional parameters (Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients) in
    order to handle voiced/unvoiced sound. Finding the best path with
    missing observations leads to one major contribution: a modified
    version of the Viterbi algorithm tailored for estimating missing
    observations. All contributions are assessed using both perceptual
    criteria and objective metrics.

    <h4>Ultrasonic Imaging Using Time Domain Topological Energy</h4>
    <p class="abstract">
      The Time Domain
      Topological Energy has been defined as a promising technique for
      nondestructive testing of complex materials. It uses mathematical
      tools derived from shape optimisation and the refocusing properties
      of time reversal allowing an efficient solution of the inverse
      problem of acoustical imaging. This method has been successfully
      adapted to the imaging of low impedance media, with properties near
      those of biological tissues and has proved to be reliable on real
      breast imaging. The main drawback of the method remains its time
      consumption. Yet, its efficiency and reliability open important
      perspectives in acoustical imaging.
